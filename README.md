 A Volunteer Force is a dedicated group of individuals who offer their time and skills for social causes without financial compensation. They participate in activities like disaster relief, education, healthcare, and community development.
  Volunteers work with NGOs, charities, and government programs to drive positive change. Their efforts strengthen communities, provide aid to those in need, and promote social responsibility. A well-organized volunteer force fosters teamwork, empathy, and a culture of giving back.
